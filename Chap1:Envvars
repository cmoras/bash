alias lz ='ls -alZ | more'


bash rc
-------
only contains section which will be only specific to only that shell:

fo rinstance lets export a var 

var=/usr/sec/sbin

then run >> bash :  this should create a shell with e new env varialbe. how ever the existing shell will not have it

export HITCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL:ignorespace

bash logout 
-----------
