Commnad substitution and envaars
--------------------------------

Generally speaking when a shell script is run, it invokes another shell to run it. So lets say that we have issued an alias in the script, 
but on execution this wont be exported to the new shell. Hence we use a command called shopt to export to that one and then alias calling 
out other commands should give out output.


command:
shopt -s expand_aliases


exit stus and exit codes
------------------------
Best way to check for exit staus would be use of echo $?
gives the exist code for the last run command


making useof the command set -e , causes the script to exit out of shell in case a paticular sectio cannot be completed, immediately.


Envaar
------
ways to check the en vars are:
env and printenv

set gives vars local to my session


Quotes and escape characters
----------------------------
\ ----> ignore the meaning of what comes after it
'' ----> preserver the value of whats inside it,  eg: echo out whatever is inside.
"" ----> checks if there are any variables , and puts out the value for that.

Shell expansions and globbing:
------------------------------
expansion involves use of {} to put in all cases for example

echo abc{r}
or echo abc{e,y}

to grep for environment vars
env | grep "HO*"

or we can try 
echo "${!HO*} ---> print out anything thing that starts with HO in terms of my envaar.
