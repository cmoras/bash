what are file descriptors?

Numeric description of a file that you may want to read/write and determin how to open that file at runtime. 
0 1 2 are system reserved fd's
< 3 are good to go 

0 - std i/p
1 - std o/p
2 - std err

example  to read and write a file using file descriptors:

#!/bin/bash

echo  "raeding a file"
read file

#pick a file handle  with a number greater than 3
#exec 5> write only 
#exec 5< read only
#exec 5<> both 

exec 5<>$file

while read -r var1; do 
	echo "var1 value: $var1"
done <&5

echo "File was read oon `date`" >&5

exec 5>&-
