This will be about traps. :D With this we can look for an occurance of an event and act accordingly

For instance when creating a menu to choose from.  a cntr + c can kick the script to the curb.  however with trap we can create a catch section whcih can catch the SIGINT or SIGTERM and display a clean
message 

example of a menu:

clear

trap 'echo "please press Q"' SIGINT SIGTERM SIGTSTP EXIT

while [ "$ch" != "Q" ] && [ "$ch" != "q" ]; do 
	echo "1) one"
	echo "2) 2"
	echo "Q) Quit"
	echo ""
	read ch
	clear
done 


#kill -9 cannot be captured.
