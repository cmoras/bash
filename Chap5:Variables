This section with deal with setting up varibles.
Two types of declaration:
--implicit
--explicit

Implicit
-------
var="hello"
var1=12;

This here is an example of implicit declaration.  Automatically identifies whether its string or int.


explicit
--------
declare -i nerve=10

now i have declared and initialized the varaible nerve to the value of 10.
in oorder to test it out call out 

declare -p nerve

you should see something indicating that it is "int" like -i 
if explicitly declared as int as in case earlier,  we cannot set the value of nerve as a different type like a string.

use cases
---------

for instance:
nerve=910 
echo $nerve shold give 910 as the answer
however
nerve="hello this is poodipie"
echo $nerve output : 0


so the type needs to be changed 

declare +i nerve
now a declare -p nerve should give no indication of what type the variable belongs to 
so once this is the case you can run
nerve="this is poodipie"

should gimme us the ansee


other ways of doing it 

declare -r nerve1="jeloo"

shold make this readonly
